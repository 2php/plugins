# Plugin list

A list to keep track of plugin compatibilities out there.
This list may be converted to a .yaml or .json for consumption by hover at some point.
See https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/issues/143

## Compatible with existing plugins

When adding to this list, include links to the original pub.dev, original source, and the go-flutter desktop version source (or gitlab, etc.). Make sure the go-flutter version actually tries to stay compatible with the original. Standalone plugins have their own list below.

### sqlite

- Original pub.dev: https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite
- Original source: https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite
- Go-flutter source: https://github.com/nealwon/go-flutter-plugin-sqlite

### open_file

- Original pub.dev: https://pub.dev/packages/open_file
- Original source: https://github.com/crazecoder/open_file
- Go-flutter source: https://github.com/jld3103/go-flutter-open_file

## Standalone plugins

Some plugins may only benefit desktop applications, and do not have an 'original' counterpart. These "standalone" plugins are listed here.
